Sober Rides (name is still in development) is a hybrid mobile app that provides a safe driving service to university students, driven by other university students. Currently the service has a lose operation consisting of drivers posting their contact information and prices on Facebook. Our app unifies all the riders and drivers onto one service and provides privacy to the students willing to drive. 

The app's UI/UX is built on the Ionic Framework and the backend services such as user authentication and storing user information is handled by Firebase. 

The app was started as an idea for a Hackathon hosted by the University of Bridgeport; however we intend on continuing development even after the hackathon concludes. The current progress was made over a 36 hour period thus, the currently the app is in its very early stages.
